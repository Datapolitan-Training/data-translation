# The Role of Data Analysis

---

# What is Data?
--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe what happened directly or indirectly

# What is Analysis?
--

> Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison
> 
> - [Carter Hewgley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterhewgley/)

---

# Final Thoughts
--

+ Data can tell a story, but doesn't speak for itself
--

+ Good "translation" is about telling a true and compelling story
